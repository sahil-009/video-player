Objective
Build a mobile-first video player application with a seamless user experience similar to the
YouTube mobile app. The focus should be on smooth playback, gesture-based interactions,
clean UI, and high performance. (Note: Dataset on last page)
1. Home Page – Video Feed
●​ Layout: Display a scrollable list of videos grouped by category.
●​ Video Cards: Each card must include:
○​ Thumbnail
○​ Title
○​ Duration
○​ Category badge
●​ Interactions:
○​ Clicking a video opens it in a full-page video player.
○​ Implement smooth transitions between the list view and player view.
●​ Tech Stack: Use any modern frontend framework (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.).
2. Full-Page Video Player
●​ Playback: Video should auto-play upon opening.
●​ Custom Controls:
○​ Play / Pause toggle.
○​ Skip forward (+10 seconds) and backward (-10 seconds).
○​ Seekable progress bar.
○​ Current time / total duration display.
●​ Responsiveness: Fully responsive for both mobile and desktop.
●​ Format: Support MP4 videos (HLS support is a bonus).
3. In-Player Video List
While a video is playing, allow users to:
●​ Reveal List: Swipe up or scroll down to reveal a related video list.
●​ Filtering: Show only videos from the same category.
●​ Selection: Clicking a video from the list should:
○​ Switch playback to the selected video immediately.
○​ Auto-play the new video.
○​ Update the list if the category changes.
●​ Experience: Ensure smooth scrolling and fluid animations.4. Drag-to-Minimize Video Player
Implement a "Picture-in-App" experience:
●​ Gestures: Allow users to drag the video player downward.
●​ Docking: Video should shrink and dock into a bottom mini-player.
●​ Mini-Player Features:
○​ Small video preview (continues playing).
○​ Video title.
○​ Play / Pause control.
○​ Close button.
●​ Persistence: The mini-player should persist while the user browses the home page.
●​ Restoration: Tapping the mini-player must restore it to full-screen mode.
Bonus Challenges (Optional)
●​ Auto-play Next: Automatically play the next video in the category when the current
one ends (include a 2-second countdown with a cancel option).
●​ Virtualization: Use virtual lists or infinite scrolling for large datasets.
●​ PiP Support: Implement the official Browser Picture-in-Picture API.
●​ Visual Feedback: Enhanced animations for the +10 / -10 skip buttons.
Technical Expectations

●​Design: Mobile-first responsive design.
Performance: Smooth animations (aiming for 60fps).
Interactions: Robust touch and gesture support.
Code Quality: Clean, readable, and maintainable code.
Styling: Any approach is welcome (Tailwind, CSS-in-JS, SASS).
Architecture: State management and TypeScript are optional but highly encouraged.

Submission Requirements
Please provide the following:
1.​ GitHub Repository: Public link to the source code.
2.​ Live Demo: Deployed URL (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare).
3.​ Documentation: A README file with setup instructions and a feature list.
4.​ Demo Video: (Optional) A short screen recording of the app in action.Evaluation Criteria
●​ Completeness: Are all core requirements, including the video feed and custom
controls, fully implemented?
●​ UI / UX Quality: Is the interface intuitive, visually polished, and consistent with
modern mobile standards?
●​ Code Structure & Clarity: Is the project organized logically, with clean, readable, and
maintainable code?
●​ Performance & Smoothness: Does the app feel "native," maintaining high frame rates
during transitions and touch interactions?
